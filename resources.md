# What you can find here:
Some tips for **Ruby/Ruby on Rails/Javascript/HTML/CSS** .

## Ruby
1. [Ruby doc](http://ruby-doc.org/)
  * Use as your bible, learn basic ruby method here
  * Choose your ruby version first
  * Some tricky things:
    * Check `Enumerable` class as well when you want to know methods applicable to `Array`, `Hash` class


## Ruby on Rails
1. [RAILS GUIDES](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
  * Enough amount of explanations, samples for each topic
  * Great content with `Active Record` and `Action View`
    * ex) validation, association, form_for helper, layouts etc...
  * I use this whenever I got stack about rails
  * Use this as a dictionary

1. [Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
  * If you are new, and don't know "what MVC model is", read this first
    * MVC model is explained in [chapter 2](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app#sec-mvc_in_action)

    * You don't need to read through all chapters, but I recommend to check chapter 1 to 6
  * Recommended to learn by yourself
  * Book goes through with theoretical backgrounds and explanations
  * Contains configuration part at the beginning
  * You'll actually create several simple rails project along with this book(simple twitter app)


## Rspec for Rails
1. [RSpec Rails](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs)
  * Adequate examples, easy to read

1. [Better Specs](http://www.betterspecs.org/)
  * Good practices for rspec
  * I recommend to read this first, because it's not so heavy amount

## Javascript
1. [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
  * Like 'Rails Tutorial', you can learn by yourself with this
  * More like book, not a dictionary

1. [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  * Useful as a dictionary
  * Under 'Built-in objects', click one to see the lists of methods for that object
